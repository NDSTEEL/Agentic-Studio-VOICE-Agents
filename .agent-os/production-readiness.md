## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Set up environment variables and API keys
2. **This Week**: Implement core voice processing pipeline
3. **Next Week**: Database integration and authentication
4. **Month Goal**: MVP deployment to staging environment

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Need to implement caching and rate limiting
- **Voice Latency**: Optimize audio streaming for real-time performance
- **Cost Management**: Monitor API usage to control costs

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement Redis caching for frequent requests
- Use WebRTC for low-latency audio streaming
- Set up usage quotas and monitoring alerts
