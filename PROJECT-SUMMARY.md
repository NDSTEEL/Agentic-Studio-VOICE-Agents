# Agentic Studio - Voice Agent Management Platform

## 🎯 What We're Building

A **no-code B2B SaaS platform** where businesses can create, customize, and deploy AI voice agents without any technical skills. Think "Shopify for Voice Agents" - businesses select a template, upload their knowledge base, customize their brand, and deploy instantly.

## 💡 Core Platform Features

- **Guided Setup Wizard**: Answer simple questions about what the agent should do
- **Safe Tweaking Zone**: Adjust agent behavior without breaking functionality
- **Performance Dashboard**: Monitor conversations, analytics, and agent performance

### Platform Safeguards
