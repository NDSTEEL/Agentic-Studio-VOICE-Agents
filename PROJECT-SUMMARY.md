# Agentic Studio VOICE Agents - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We're Building

A web platform for real-time voice conversations with AI assistants. Users speak naturally to an AI agent that understands, processes, and responds with a human-like voice.

## 💡 Core Functionality

- Users click to speak into their microphone
- Speech converts to text (OpenAI Whisper)
- AI generates intelligent responses (GPT-4)
- Responses play back as natural speech (ElevenLabs)
- Full conversation history displayed on screen

## 🏗️ Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Full UI/UX with animations and visual feedback
- Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript
- Frontend components and styling
- Technical documentation

### 🚧 Needs Implementation
- Voice API integrations (Whisper, GPT-4, ElevenLabs)
- Backend API routes for processing
- WebSocket for real-time audio streaming
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma
- Error handling and recovery

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend (Done)
- Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- TailwindCSS with custom animations
- Responsive voice interface

### Backend (To Build)
- API Routes: `/api/voice/transcribe`, `/api/voice/synthesize`, `/api/chat/complete`
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Real-time: Socket.io WebSocket
- Deployment: Vercel

## 📊 Development Phases

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Basic voice conversation functionality
**Phase 2**: Multi-agent system for specialized conversations
**Phase 3**: Production scaling and infrastructure
**Phase 4**: Enterprise features and customization

## 🎨 User Flow

1. User opens app → sees voice interface
2. Holds microphone button → records voice
3. Releases button → audio processes through pipeline
4. AI responds → plays through speakers
5. Conversation continues naturally

## 💼 Target Market

- Small/medium businesses needing voice support
- Call centers augmenting human agents
- Healthcare providers for patient interaction
- E-commerce voice-enabled assistance

## 📈 Success Metrics

- Voice response latency < 500ms
- Handle 100+ concurrent conversations
- 99% uptime reliability
- 2-week MVP, 4-6 weeks to production
