# Freelancer Hiring Guide - Voice Agents Project

## 🎯 What to Ask the Freelancer to Do

### Specific Tasks (Copy this for your job posting):

**Title: Next.js Developer for Voice AI Web Application**

I need a Next.js developer to implement the backend functionality for a voice agent web application. The UI is already built.

**Specific deliverables:**
1. Connect OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text
2. Integrate ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech
3. Create API routes for voice processing
4. Implement WebSocket for real-time audio streaming
5. Set up PostgreSQL database with Prisma
6. Add error handling and loading states
7. Write basic tests for API endpoints

**NOT required:**
- UI/UX design (already done)
- DevOps/deployment (will handle separately)
- AI/ML model development (using existing APIs)

## 🔐 How to Share Access SAFELY

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- Give full repository access immediately
- Share your API keys directly
- Give access to your main/production branch
- Share database credentials
- Give admin access to your GitHub account

### ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD:

#### Option 1: Fork Strategy (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
1. Freelancer forks your repository
2. They work on their fork
3. They submit pull requests
4. You review and merge code
```

**Pros:** Maximum safety, code review built-in
**Cons:** Slightly more complex workflow

#### Option 2: Branch Protection
```bash
1. Add freelancer as collaborator with limited access
2. Protect main branch (require PR reviews)
3. Freelancer works on feature branches
4. All changes go through PR review
```

**Pros:** Direct collaboration, easier communication
**Cons:** They see your entire codebase

#### Option 3: Separate Repository (MOST SECURE)
```bash
1. Create new repo with only necessary code
2. Remove sensitive files and history
3. Give freelancer access to this clean repo
4. Manually merge changes to main repo
```

**Pros:** Maximum security, minimal exposure
**Cons:** More work for you

## 📁 What Files to Share

### SHARE These Files:
```
✅ /src/app/page.tsx (UI component)
✅ /src/app/layout.tsx
✅ package.json
✅ tsconfig.json
✅ tailwind.config.ts
✅ README.md
✅ .env.example (template only)
```

### DON'T SHARE These:
```
❌ .env (your actual API keys)
❌ .git history (if sensitive)
❌ Any files with credentials
❌ Production deployment configs
❌ Analytics or monitoring keys
```

## 🔑 API Keys & Secrets Management

### For Development:
1. **Create separate development API keys**
   - OpenAI: Create a restricted key with usage limits
   - ElevenLabs: Use their free tier or limited key
   - Set spending limits on all services

2. **Use environment variables**
   ```javascript
   // Freelancer gets .env.example
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxx  # They add their own
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxx        # Or you provide limited keys
   ```

3. **Implement key rotation**
   - Change keys after freelancer completes work
   - Use different keys for dev/staging/production
